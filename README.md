#### /experiment_notebooks: 

#### /model_notebooks: 

#### /src: 
All source code for the project.

AI Acknowledgement: extensive use of Claude Sonnet 4 for debugging continuity, essentially all plotting, including nearly the entirety of network_analysis.jl

Used code from notebooks 2, 5, HW 3, 5, Lab 3
